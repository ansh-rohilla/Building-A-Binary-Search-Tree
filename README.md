# Building-A-Binary-Search-Tree
The code builds a Binary Search Tree (BST) from a given array of integers and then performs an in-order traversal to print the elements in sorted order. A BST is a binary tree where for every node, all nodes in its left subtree have a value less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have a value greater than the node's value.
